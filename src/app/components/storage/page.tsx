          <h2 className={H2}>What Is Computer Storage?</h2>
          <p className={P}>
            Computer storage is the component that keeps data permanently. When
            you install a program, save a document, or download a game, it is
            written to a storage drive and survives restarts. Storage comes in
            two main technologies: solid-state drives (SSDs) with no moving
            parts, and hard disk drives (HDDs) with spinning magnetic platters.
          </p>

          <h2 className={H2}>SSD — Solid-State Drive</h2>
          <p className={P}>
            An SSD stores data on NAND flash memory chips. With no moving
            parts, it delivers near-instant boot times, snappy application
            loading, and resistance to shock. SATA SSDs reach about 550 MB/s —
            already ten times faster than a hard drive — while NVMe SSDs
            connect over PCIe lanes and reach multiple gigabytes per second.

          <p className={P}>
            An HDD stores data magnetically on platters spinning at 5,400 or
            7,200 RPM. It is the cheapest way to add terabytes of capacity,
            which is why hard drives still dominate bulk archives, backups,
            and NAS storage — even though SSDs have replaced them for operating
            systems and games.

          <h2 className={H2}>NVMe and SATA — How Drives Connect</h2>
          <p className={P}>
            SATA is the older serial interface that tops out at about 550 MB/s
            and serves both 2.5-inch SSDs and hard drives. NVMe (Non-Volatile
            Memory Express) is a protocol that lets flash storage talk directly
            to the CPU over PCIe lanes,             bypassing SATA&apos;s bottleneck entirely —
            the reason M.2 NVMe drives can read beyond 7 GB/s.

        <section className={SECTION}>
          <h2 className={H2}>Storage Capacity and Speed</h2>
          <p className={P}>
            Capacity, measured in gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB), decides
            how many programs, games, and files you can keep installed. Speed
            decides how fast they open: SSDs dominate random-access workloads
            like booting and launching apps, while sequential throughput
            matters for large file transfers. A common desktop setup pairs a
            fast NVMe SSD for the operating system with a large HDD for
            archives.

          <h2 className={H2}>Storage vs RAM</h2>
          <p className={P}>
            Storage and RAM are both memory, but they do different jobs.
            Storage is permanent: it keeps data when the power is off. RAM is
            fast, temporary working memory that holds what the CPU is using
            right now and erases when the PC shuts down. Programs load from
            storage into RAM before the processor can use them, which is why
            enough RAM matters for smooth multitasking.
